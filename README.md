Cyber Security Internship Tasks
This repository includes the tasks I completed during my virtual internship in Cyber Security.

Each task focuses on a different aspect of cybersecurity and demonstrates various techniques and solutions.

The projects are written in Python and showcase the practical application of security principles.

Tasks Assigned

Task 01 :  Implement Caesar Cipher

Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Task 03 :  Password Complexity Checker

Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The tool provides feedback on the password's strength.

Task 04 :  Simple Keylogger

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes.
The keylogger logs the keys pressed and saves them to a file.
Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.
